			<h2 id="head-intro" class="heading">Introduction</h2>
			<p>Colour theory is a broad topic that has been discussed for many years, for those reading I hope to give a brief but spectacular look into the world of colours. At medium pontential colours should make a page's content to be comprehensible, at their minimum potential colours will can complete destroy to look of a page and make it unreadble. At their maximum potential colours can be used to convey emotions from a reader and encourage them to engage in the page, this will all be explained later but for now let us go back to the basics...</p>
		</section>

		<seciton id="achromatic">
			<h2 id="head-achro" class="heading">Achromatic Colours</h2>
			<p>The achromatic colour group consists of three colours: black (a complete absence of colour), white (created with the presence of all primary colours) and grey (a 50/50 blend of the former two). Black can be used to express power, elegance, mystery or evil, white can be used to express integrity, purity or innocence and grey can be used to express security, reliability and emotionlessness. These are known to be the most basic of colours and with them we could make a perfectly eligible page, but to be honest things with look a bit dull if we used them exclusively (think back to black and white films) so next we have...</p>

		<section id="primary">
			<h2 id="head-prim" class="heading">Primary Colours</h2>
			<p>There are three generallu argeed upon primary colours, red, green and blue and with these you can make any other of the over 16 million colours! Red is can be used to express energy, danger or excitement, green can be used to express growth, healing or peace and blue can be used to express truth, loyalty or coldness. Shades of red are known as "warm colours" and are used for heat related items, shades of blue and green are known are "cool colours" are are used for cold or nature based items.</p>

		<section id="secondary">
			<h2 id="head-sec" class="heading">Secondary Colours</h2>
			<p>Secondary colours are made using mixtures red, green and blue. Including those there are three more colours in this group, cyan (made with green and blue) which can be used to express calmness, relaxation or rest, magenta (made with red and blue) which can be used to express imaginativeness, royalty or cooperation and yellow (made with red and green) which are be used to express happiness, clarity or youthfulness. The interseting thing about these three is many people consider them to be the true primary colours and not the ones noted before! Why? Well using these three colours you can also create any other colour, if you don't believe me take a look at a printer. You'll see it uses the cmyk (cyan, magenta, yellow, key, the last of which stands for black) colour scheme and uses only those colours to print images of any colour. Of course that includes red (magenta and yellow), green (cyan and yellow) and blue (magenta and cyan)! The only differecne between the rgb (red, green, blue) and cmyk colour schemes is that if you mix all the colours of the former scheme you will get white and black is known as a complete absence of colour, however if you mix all the colours of the latter scheme you will get black and white is known as a complete absence of colour, weird right?</p>

		<section id="tertiary">
			<h2 id="head-tert" class="heading">Tertiary Colours</h2>
			<p>The last of these colour groups we are going to explore is tertiary colours, a group made with the combination of both shades of primary and secondary colours. This group adds an additional 6 colours which are made using colours from the previous sections. These colours are vermilion (between red and orange), amber (between orange and yellow), chartreuse (between yellow and green), teal (between green and blue), indigo (between blue and purple) and maroon (between indigo and red). Using these colours you'll have the tools to make beautiful pages but you must use an appropriate colour balance. If you have green text on an yellow background that would be difficult to read as these to colours are very similar so generally you want your page to have a dominant colour and one or more complementary colour(s) (think Facebook's blue and white logo or JavaScript's yellow and black logo), speaking of complementary colours...</p>

		<section id="complementary">
			<h2 id="head-comp" class="heading">Complementary Colours</h2>
			<p>Complementary colours are pairs of colours which when combined together create a greyscale colour like black, grey or white. Generally these colours are opposite each other on the colour wheel (red and shades of green, yellow and purple, blue and orange) so create a perfect contrast. While these are the complementary colours they are generally not used in the dominant and complementary colour screen as the difference between the two colours can be a bit too jarring and may strain a users eyes. Instead of for background and text, they are used alot in single images (like red and shades of green for christmas or blue and orange for halloween) where your focus is not a specific point but the entire area.</p>

		<section id="triadic">
			<h2 id="head-tri" class="heading">Triadic Colours</h2>
			<p>Triadic colours are groups of 3 colours that are seperated by 120 degrees on a colour wheel and when those points are joined up by straight lines can make an equilateral triangle. Examples of triadic colours are red, blue and yellow, orange, green and purple and amber, teal and maroon. These sets of colours tend to be quite vibrant whichever position you choose one the colour wheel and manage to a good amount of contrast will not appearing too jarring for a viewer. For this reason they are extremely popular among artists and designers and are perfect for building your page due to the ease of which you can create them.</p>

		<section id="analogous">
			<h2 id="head-ana" class="heading">Analogous Colours</h2>
			<p>Analogous colours are also groups of 3 colours but are seperated by 30 degrees on the colour wheel making them adjacent to one another and consisting of one primary or secondary colour and two tertiary colours (or vice versa). These schemes can also create pages but must be used carefully as they including very similar colours so can easily make your page look incomprehensible. The reason this is a widely used scheme is because the colours are so simliar they are great at envoking emotions like mystery for indigo, purple and maroon or nature for yellow, chartreuse and green.</p>

		<section id="monochromatic">
			<h2 id="head-mono" class="heading">Monochromatic Colours</h2>
			<p>A monochromatic colour scheme uses only one colour from the colour wheel then adds either black (also known as adding shade) or white (also known as adding tint) to create lighter or darker shades of that colour. When used well this system can be very pleasing on the eyes and can also be used to evoke emotions since the colours used will be very similar.</p>

		<section id="summary">
			<h2 id="head-sum" class="heading">Summary</h2>
			<p>And so we've reached the end of this introductory colour course. I hope you enjoyed learning about colour theory and can now implement some of what you've learn't into your own projects. Of course this is only and introductory course so there are many things I didn't go over like quaternary colours, teradic colours and deeper colour psychology. You might have even noted that I used different fonts on this page which brings us to the topic typography, the art of using different fonts on a page to express a quality, but that is a completely different subject... of which to explain, I'd actually have to become proficient in first...</p>
