			<p>Colour theory is a broad topic that has been discussed for many years, for those reading I hope to give a brief but spectacular look into the world of colours. At medium pontential colours should make a page's content to be comprehensible, at their minimum potential colours will can complete destroy to look of a page and make it unreadble. At their maximum potential colours can be used to convey emotions from a reader and encourage them to engage in the page, this will all be explained later but for now let us go back to the basics...</p>

			<h2 id="head-achro" class="heading">Achromatic Colours</h2>
			<p>The achromatic colour group consists of three colours: black (a complete absence of colour), white (created with the presence of all primary colours) and grey (a 50/50 blend of the former two). Black can be used to express power, elegance, mystery or evil, white can be used to express integrity, purity or innocence and grey can be used to express security, reliability and emotionlessness. These are known to be the most basic of colours and with them we could make a perfectly eligible page, but to be honest things with look a bit dull if we used them exclusively (think back to black and white films) so next we have...</p>

		<section id="primary">
			<h2 id="head-prim" class="heading">Primary Colours</h2>
			<p>There are three univerisally argeed on primary colours, red, green and blue and with these you can make any other of the over 16 million colours! Red is can be used to express energy, danger or excitement, green can be used to express growth, healing or peace and blue can be used to express truth, loyalty or coldness. Shades of red are known as "warm colours" and are used for heat related items, shades of blue and green are known are "cool colours" are are used for cold or nature based items.</p>

		<section id="secondary">
			<h2 id="head-sec" class="heading">Secondary Colours</h2>
			<p>Secondary colours are made using mixtures red, green and blue. There are three in total, cyan (made with green and blue) which can be used to express calmness, relaxation or rest, magenta (made with red and blue) which can be used to express imaginativeness, royalty or cooperation and yellow (made with red and green) which are be used to express happiness, clarity or youthfulness. The interseting thing about these three is many people consider them to be the true primary colours and not the one noted before! Why? Well using these three colours you can also create any other colour, if you don't believe me take a look at a printer. You'll see it uses the cmyk (cyan, magenta, yellow, key, the last of which stands for black) colour scheme and uses only those colours to print images of any colour. Of course that includes red (magenta and yellow), green (cyan and yellow) and blue (magenta and cyan)! The only differecne between the rgb (red, green, blue) and cmyk colour schemes is that if you mix all the colours of the former scheme you will get white and black is known as a complete absence of colour, however if you mix all the colours of the latter scheme you will get black and white is known as a complete absence of colour, weird right?</p>
